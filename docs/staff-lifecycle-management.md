## Usage Examples

### Starting an Onboarding Process

```typescript
import StaffOnboardingWorkflow from "@/components/staff/lifecycle/StaffOnboardingWorkflow";

function OnboardingPage() {
  const handleComplete = (data: StaffOnboardingData) => {
    // Process completed onboarding data
    console.log("Onboarding completed:", data);
  };

  const handleSave = (data: Partial<StaffOnboardingData>) => {
    // Save progress
    console.log("Saving progress:", data);
  };

  return (
    <StaffOnboardingWorkflow
      businessId="your-business-id"
      onComplete={handleComplete}
      onSave={handleSave}
    />
  );
}
```

### Initiating a Staff Transfer

```typescript
import StaffTransferWorkflow from "@/components/staff/lifecycle/StaffTransferWorkflow";

function TransferPage() {
  const currentStaff = {
    name: "John Doe",
    position: "Server",
    department: "Service",
    manager: "Jane Smith",
    salary: 15.5,
  };

  const handleComplete = (data: StaffTransferData) => {
    // Process transfer completion
    console.log("Transfer completed:", data);
  };

  return (
    <StaffTransferWorkflow
      staffId="staff-123"
      currentStaffData={currentStaff}
      onComplete={handleComplete}
      onCancel={() => console.log("Transfer cancelled")}
    />
  );
}
```

## Data Structures
