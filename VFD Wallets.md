2. Consent Method
The IGREE Process

The developer calls the account creation endpoint and passes the client Bio-data (payload required as stated in the documentation)
The account is created immediately and placed on PND.
The developer calls the wallet2/bvn-consent endpoint to get the customer’s consent.
If the consent returned is false, then the consent URL returned to the developer should be displayed to the customer.
The customer clicks on the URL and is directed to the consent management service page.
The customer inputs the BVN, is directed to select the contact linked with the BVN (email/phone number) that would be used in receiving the OTP, and clicks submit.
An OTP is generated and sent to the customer.
The customer is redirected to the OTP authentication page to input the OTP and grant consent.
The developer consent webhook is notified once consent has been granted.
The developer calls the /client/release endpoint to lift PND.
The merchant is notified of all pending inflows, if any.

Please note that for cases where customers require another account, once consent has been given for the first, there is no need to initiate the consent process for the extra account as it would not be placed on PND.

HOW TO MAKE A TRANSFER

During Transfer the first process is to call the account enquiry API (a) to get the From details for the transfer payload.

The second process is to call the bank list API to get the bank codes.

The third process is to call the transfer recipient endpoint (b) to get the beneficiary or ‘’TO’’ details.

The fourth process is to generate the signature using SHA512(fromAccount ToAccount). The accounts should be concatenated together. There is a table below that shows how to populate the transfer payload
